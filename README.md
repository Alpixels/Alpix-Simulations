# 🧪 Alpixels Simulation Tracker

Welcome to the **Simulation Tracker Repository** — a centralized and version-controlled system for monitoring, logging, and organizing simulation runs across multiple computational physics techniques.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository is designed to support and track simulations performed using:

- **Molecular Dynamics (MD)**
- **Monte Carlo (MC)**
- **Brownian Dynamics (BD)**

Simulations are organized by technique and by project name, with each run logged in a dedicated file automatically generated by the simulation script.

```

- Each **technique** has its own main folder.
- Inside each technique, **projects** are organized into subfolders.
- Each project folder contains **individual log files** per simulation run (`log_sim_XXX.txt`), automatically generated.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- 🗃️  Maintain a history of all simulation runs in one place.
- 🧾 Log relevant metadata like method, project name, run status, timestamps, etc.
- 🔁 Enable automation of logging and Git version control directly from simulation scripts.
- 📈 Facilitate reproducibility, tracking, and collaboration across simulation projects.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Each time a simulation is launched from an automated script, it creates or appends a log file containing:

- **Technique**: MD, MC, or BD
- **Project name**
- **Run ID** or filename
- **Status**: Completed, Failed, Running
- **Start & end timestamps**
- **Execution time**
- **Comments or results**

Then, the script automatically commits the log to this Git repository — ensuring version control without manual steps.

## 🚀 Coming Soon
